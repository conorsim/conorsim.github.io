        <h1>Simmons, Conor</h1>
        <p>I was born in Colorado and I love backpacking and getting outside. Because of this, I have had multiple a couple of standoffs with bears. I also have a strong connection to music. In fact, I have played principal trumpet in a symphony orchestra and lead trumpet in a jazz band. I have been to more countries than I have states. I am studying Computer Science because I enjoy programming quite a bit and am intrigued by machine learning.</p>
